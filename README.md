Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Python
============================================

Welcome to my DSA repository! This project is a curated collection of Python scripts developed to master fundamental and advanced algorithmic concepts. It covers a wide spectrum of topics including recursion, sorting algorithms, tree structures, and mathematical series.

🚀 Overview

This repository serves as a technical showcase of my ability to implement complex logic and efficient data structures. Each script is designed for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to Pythonic coding standards.

📂 Project Structure
--------------------

### 1\. Sorting Algorithms

I have implemented several classic sorting algorithms, providing a deep dive into time and space complexity trade-offs.

I have implemented several classic sorting algorithms, providing a deep dive into time and space complexity trade-offs.

-   **Bubble Sort:** A fundamental comparison-based algorithm. ``
-   **Selection Sort:** Implementation focusing on finding minimum elements. ``
-   **Insertion Sort:** Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays. ``
-   **Merge Sort:** A robust **Divide and Conquer** implementation ensuring $O(n \log n)$ performance. ``
-   **Quick Sort:** A high-performance partitioning algorithm using the Lomuto/Hoare-style logic. ``

### 2\. Tree Structures (Binary Search Tree)

A comprehensive **Binary Search Tree (BST)** implementation featuring:

-   **Dynamic Operations:** Insertion, search, and deletion (handling leaf, single-child, and two-child nodes). ``
-   **Traversals:** In-Order, Pre-Order, and Post-Order traversal methods. ``
-   **Tree Stats:** Methods to retrieve the root, minimum value, and maximum value within the structure. ``

### 3\. Recursion & Combinatorics

Demonstrating the power of recursive thinking through various mathematical and string manipulation problems:

-   **Permutations:** Algorithms to generate all possible string arrangements and count permutation totals. ``
-   **Factorials & Fibonacci:** Standard recursive implementations with input validation for negative or decimal values. ``
-   **Exponentiation:** Recursive power function ($x^y$). ``

### 4\. Mathematical Series & Patterns

A collection of scripts solving specific series challenges, often found in competitive programming:

-   **Triangular Numbers & Cube Series:** Recursive logic to calculate cumulative sums and cubic progressions. ``
-   **Custom Progressions:** Implementations for specific series logic, such as $f(n) = f(n-1) + 4n + 1$. ``
